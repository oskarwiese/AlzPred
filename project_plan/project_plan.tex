\section{What will we be doing?}
Research Question: Is it possible with tools of ML to predict Alzheimers at an earlier stage than previously possible?
\begin{itemize}
	\item How can a cycle-GAN be used to convert between 1.5T and 3T MRI images? Does the data prove useful for classification? (Based on preliminary studies it is found that 1.5T and 3T respectively create noise. Can we then try to find a way to compensate for this by generating 1.5T from 3T and reverse using a CycleGan)
	\item How effective is the prediction model in predicting whether a patient has alzheimer's disease? ( Possibility of further developing the current model with more specific methods )
	\item How will the model change the future? (Societal and economic impacts given the success of the prediction model?)
\end{itemize}
